### Keybase Issues

Please tell us any problems you have with Keybase. We also welcome questions and comments.

Keybase has a few repos (see below), and we can't expect you to know where to post issues. So post everything here. We'll tag and organize it all.

### To post an issue / comment / whatever

Click the "issues" tab. (Or: https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues). Alpha testers, you can bookmark that page :-)

### If you'd like to review our code

We'd like that too.

  * https://github.com/keybase/node-client - the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/node-installer - the installer for the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/gpg-wrapper - library for communicating with GPG's CLI
  * https://github.com/keybase/pgp-utils - crypto utilities for dealing with MACs, Signatures, and PGP message formats.

#### Thanks!
