### Keybase Issues

Please tell us any problems you have with Keybase. We also welcome questions and comments here in the issues.

Keybase has a few repos (the client, the installer, some shared code for the browser, etc.), and we can't expect you to know where to go. So just post your bugs, issues, questions, and comments here. We'll tag them if you don't.

### To post an issue/bug/comment/question/whatever

Click the "issues" tab. (Or: https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues). Don't be afraid to bookmark that page if you're one of our alpha testers.

### If you'd like to review our code

We'd like that too.

  * https://github.com/keybase/node-client - the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/node-installer - the installer for the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/gpg-wrapper - library for communicating with GPG's CLI
  * https://github.com/keybase/pgp-utils - crypto utilities for dealing with MACs, Signatures, and PGP message formats.

#### Thanks!
