### Tell us everything!

There's an [issues tab](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues) in the right margin of this page. The direct link:

  - https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues

We appreciate comments, questions, feature requests, etc.

Keybase has a few repos (see below), and we can't expect you to know where to post issues. So post everything here. We'll tag and organize it all.

### If you'd like to review our code

We'd like that too.

  * https://github.com/keybase/node-client - the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/node-installer - the installer for the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/gpg-wrapper - library for communicating with GPG's CLI
  * https://github.com/keybase/pgp-utils - crypto utilities for dealing with MACs, Signatures, and PGP message formats.

#### Thanks!
